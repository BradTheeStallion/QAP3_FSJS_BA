**QAP3: User Management System**

This repository was generated from https://github.com/menglishca/user-management-base

Welcome to the 3rd (and final) QAP for my Full-Stack JavaScript course at Keyin College. I modified the template provided by my instructor to produce a Node.js Express application for user authentication and management with role-based access control. Key features include:

*User registration with secure password hashing
*User login with session management
*Role-based access control (admin/user)
*Admin dashboard to view all registered users
*Secure logout functionality

My key tasks here were to create a landing.ejs page and fill in the missing pieces of the index.js script.

Here is a link to the original repo's README: https://github.com/menglishca/user-management-base/blob/main/README.md

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
